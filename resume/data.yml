about: Hi, my name is Marc Hage. I"m just about the most boring type of person you could
       possibly imagine. I've always worked with web languages. I love coding, keeping 
       things simple and/or adhering to technical standards. I used to steer clear of 
       javascript. Now it is the opposite.
